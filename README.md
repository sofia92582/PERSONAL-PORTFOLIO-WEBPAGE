DESCRIPTION
The objective of this task is to design and develop a real-time chat application using a front-end JavaScript framework such as React.js or Vue.js, along with WebSockets to enable live communication between users. This project demonstrates an understanding of dynamic user interfaces and real-time data transfer, which are essential skills in modern web development.

A real-time chat application allows multiple users to exchange messages instantly without refreshing the page. Unlike traditional messaging systems that require constant reloading or polling to check for new messages, WebSockets provide a persistent connection between the client and server, allowing real-time message delivery. This results in a smoother and faster user experience.

The front-end of the application should be developed using React.js or Vue.js, both of which are powerful libraries used for building interactive user interfaces. The user interface should be simple, responsive, and easy to navigate. It should include the following components:

Chat Window – Displays the ongoing conversation, showing all sent and received messages in order.

Message Input Box – A text field where users can type their messages.

Send Button – Allows users to send messages.

Message History – Previously sent messages should be visible when a user joins or reloads the page.

The application must use WebSockets to manage real-time communication. The most commonly used library for handling WebSockets in JavaScript is Socket.IO, which can be integrated with Node.js on the backend. The Socket.IO server listens for incoming messages and broadcasts them to all connected clients, enabling real-time chat functionality.

Optional enhancements may include user authentication (to identify users), timestamps for messages, message delivery indicators, and emojis. However, the core requirement is to demonstrate real-time communication and message persistence.

This task highlights the developer’s ability to integrate front-end design with real-time backend functionality. The UI must be responsive, meaning it should work smoothly across various device sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Deliverable:
The final submission should include a fully functional chat application with a clean and responsive design, real-time messaging using WebSockets, and the ability to view previous chat messages. All code must be uploaded to a GitHub repository with proper folder structure and comments for readability.

This task not only builds hands-on experience in front-end development but also introduces real-time systems — a crucial concept in many modern applications. Successfully completing this project will strengthen your understanding of how front-end and backend systems interact in a live application environment.
